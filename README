ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GUI UPDATE

This project is a branch from my original rock paper scissors game to make it more user friendly by adding a simple user interface.

**UPDATE**
This project re-make ended up being more difficult than I initially thought as a lot of the code I had initially didn't translate well to the UI I implemented.

I also picked up on and fixed a few minor bugs that I didn't catch the first time. 

Fortunately, this experience taught me more than nearly any other and I feel much more confident in my Javascript ability.
