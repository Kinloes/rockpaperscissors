This is my first project using JavaScript. It will be a simple rock paper scissors program without a UI. 

I expect this to be quite a challenge as I familiarize myself with actually writing JS code from scratch and learning the syntax. However, I expect to finish this with a much greater understanding and appreciation for what JavaScript can do.

Planning out the program with pseudocode
The program needs to explain the rules to the user and allow for the specified inputs
The program will have to randomly choose between rock, paper, and scissors
The program will need to react to user inputs accordingly (Win, loss, tie text)
The user needs to be able to re-run the program when a round finishes.

**AFTER FINISHED PROJECT**
I learned a huge amount from this project and I feel much much more confident after struggling through it initially.

Now I have a clearer idea of not only the syntax of JavaScript, but what tools I have to solve problems.
